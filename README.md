# kontrata

A project to download, process and index all contracts published at the [Basque Public Administration Public Contracts
Platform (REVASCON)](https://www.contratacion.euskadi.eus/w32-kpereva/es/y46aRevasconWar/consultaContratosC/filtro?locale=es).

This project has been inspired by [@JaimeObregon](https://twitter.com/JaimeObregon) and [contratoscantabria.es](https://contratosdecantabria.es/)

## Install

You need a recent python version, any version >= 3.7 will do.

Clone this project and create a virtualenv inside it:

``` 

python3 -m venv .

``` 

Then install the required dependencies:

``` 
./bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run each of the scripts of the pipeline.

```

./bin/python step_01_get_contracts.py
./bin/python step_02_process_contracts.py
./bin/python step_03_index_contracts.py
```

## Elastic

All the data produced in the 2nd step will be indexed in an [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/es/) service. You will need such a service to run the indexing part.

Have a look at the [sample elastic docker-compose installation](https://github.com/erral/kontrata-docker) that I am using on development. 


## Pipeline

1. step_01_get_contracts.py

- Download the original contracts JSONP file
- Cache the file
- Convert to JSON
- Cache the file
- For each contract:
  - Create a dir
  - Extract the id
  - Download the data XML file
  - Download the metadata XML file
  - Create the contract JSON file

2. step_02_process_contracts.py

- Read the existing XML files for each contract and build a json file with the relevant data

3. step_03_index_contracts.py

- Index all contracts in elastic


## Work in progress

This is a work in progress. The JSON file generated in the 2nd step (and then indexed in the 3rd step) is subject to change.

## Demo content

I have downloaded and processed all the data available on the 10th of october and make it available here, in case you do not want to wait to download all of them, I make them available here for anyone here:

- [Full download of the contract files](https://nextcloud.erral.freemyip.com/index.php/s/sE6Bx99BckH8sZP): 2 XML files (one for data and another one for metadata) and a JSON file with the summary, one per language, a total of 6 files per contract. 665 MB in total.

I have also processed all those files with the second script, and make it available here, in case you do not want to wait to process all of them (the process of the files takes usualy minutes). 

- [Full download of the processed contract files](https://nextcloud.erral.freemyip.com/index.php/s/ccwRmXeNs83HYdW): 2 JSON files, one with the XML in raw JSON (unprocessed, just converted), and another one created after processing the previous one, one per language, a total of 4 files per contract. 286 MB in total.

In the [demo](demo) folder you can find a extract of some contracts with the corresponding files.
